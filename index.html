<p>
Apache Fineract is an effort undergoing incubation at
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache
Software Foundation</a> (ASF).
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a
further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and
decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with
other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.
